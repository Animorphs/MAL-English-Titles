# MAL-English-Titles
English titles for Anime and Manga on MyAnimeList in browser.

This just uses Javascript and jQuery to get the English titles from the website itself, no external APIs.
Because of this, you will occasionally get timed out of the website if you open a lot of pages in a short period of time, but it will start working again after ~10 seconds.

Simply install JS script in TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, or similar.
