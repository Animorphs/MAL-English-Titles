## ‚ùì FAQ <a name = "faq"></a>
1. <b>MAL is timing out / [thinks I'm a bot](https://i.imgur.com/wShsC6I.png)?</b> When you browse a lot of new pages in a short amount of time, you may get temporarily timed out of MAL. If this happens, click 'Submit', wait for ~20 seconds, and then you can go back to browsing. Timeouts are most likely to happen when you <b>first install</b>, are browsing lots of pages at once, or for the first time are visiting a personal list with a lot of content. If it happens everytime you load a page, please submit a [bug report](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
2. <b>Why are some translations missing?</b> Option 1: MAL does not have an official translation for that anime or manga. Option 2: The script may have accidentally saved the blank title before it properly loaded. This will fix itself within 3 weeks, or you can force it immediately by [following these steps](https://pastebin.com/5XbdGT8u).
3. <b>Why am I not getting translations on 'x' page?</b> Currently the script supports various pages throughout MAL, but not all, as it is manually coded for each endpoint. If you are not getting translations on <b>any</b> pages, please create a bug report. If you are getting translations, and have a specific page that is not currently supported, please create a feature request.
4. <b>Why aren't you using Kitsu API so we don't get timed out?</b> Mostly because I wanted it done natively as the info is already on the website, and additionally I ran into a bug where if a title was too long on MAL ([such as this](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40496/Maou_Gakuin_no_Futekigousha__Shijou_Saikyou_no_Maou_no_Shiso_Tensei_shite_Shison-tachi_no_Gakkou_e_)), it couldn't grab the translation from Kitsu. Last but not least, if Kitsu API goes down, the script will stop working during that period as well.
5. <b>I've encountered a bug?</b> Please submit a [bug report](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
6. <b>I've got a great idea?</b> Please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
