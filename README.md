## ‚ùì FAQ <a name = "faq"></a>
1. <b>MAL is timing out / [thinks I'm a bot](https://i.imgur.com/wShsC6I.png)?</b> When you browse a lot of new pages in a short amount of time, you may get temporarily timed out of MAL. If this happens, click 'Submit', wait for ~20 seconds, and then you can go back to browsing. Timeouts are most likely to happen when you <b>first install</b>, are browsing lots of pages at once, or for the first time are visiting a personal list with a lot of content. If it happens everytime you load a page, please submit a [bug report](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
2. <b>Why are some translations missing?</b> Most likely, MAL does not have an official translation for that anime or manga. Alternatively, the script may have saved the blank title before it properly loaded. In this case, just click the relevant anime or manga to open it, and that will automatically update the translation.
3. <b>Why am I not getting translations on 'x' page?</b> Currently the script supports various pages throughout MAL, but not all, as it is manually coded for each endpoint. If you are not getting translations on <b>any</b> pages at all, submit a bug report. If you are getting translations, and have a specific page that is not currently supported, submit a feature request.
4. <b>Why aren't you using Kitsu API so we don't get timed out?</b> Primarily because I couldn't be bothered figuring it out, and I wanted it done natively as the info is already on MAL. Also if Kitsu goes down, the script will probably freak out.
5. <b>I've encountered a bug?</b> Please submit a [bug report](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
6. <b>I've got a great idea?</b> Please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/Animorphs/MAL-English-Titles/issues/new/choose).
