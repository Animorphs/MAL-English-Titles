# MAL-English-Titles
Add English titles for various Anime and Manga pages on MyAnimeList.net

This script uses Javascript and jQuery to get the English titles from the website itself, no external APIs.
If you browse a lot of pages in a short amount of time, <b>you are likely to get timed out of the website</b>, so either browse slowly, or wait for it to start working again after ~30 seconds. You can also disable the translations with the checkmark toggle (see below).
